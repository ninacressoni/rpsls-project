Python Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is a Python program that executes a Joken-po game.
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of chance that expands. 

Rules:
The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

Almost always, the boys will all pick Spock at the same time and tie over and over again.
But just in real life. 

This program randomly chooses the players and show the result of the winner 5 times in a row, according to the rules.  

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors


And just for fun, the video of Sheldon explaining this rule.
